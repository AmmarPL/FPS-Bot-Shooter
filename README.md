## About the Game
This was an assignment for my "Advanced Graphics, AR & VR" course. The game was made with OpenGL. You will spawn with a first person view on a green field with trees, rocks, and bots. You can move around the map using arrow keys and shoot using your mouse. You can see the number of kills, bots left, and bullets left on the display.

As the user moves around the map, more grass is generated in a fixed radius around the user.
