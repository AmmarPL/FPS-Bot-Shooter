## About the Game
FPS Bot Shooter is made with OpenGL and places you in a first-person view on a green field filled with trees, rocks, and bots. You can navigate the map using the arrow keys and shoot using your mouse. The display shows the number of kills, bots left, and bullets left.

As you move around the map, more grass is generated in a fixed radius around you, adding a dynamic element to the terrain.
